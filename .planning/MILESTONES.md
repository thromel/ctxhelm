# Milestones

## v1.1 Packaging & Adoption (Shipped: 2026-05-13)

**Delivered:** A packaged, documented, smoke-testable ctxpack release path for agent-native adoption.

**Phases completed:** Phases 1-8, 32 plans total

**Key accomplishments:**

- Locked compatibility and source-free contract guardrails across CLI, MCP, and JSON outputs.
- Hardened safe inventory, diagnostics, context planning, packs, eval traces, and historical retrieval reports.
- Verified agent-native client durability through deterministic MCP proof and optional Codex/Claude real-client wrappers.
- Added v1.1.0 release identity, repeatable local binary archives, SHA-256 checksums, and artifact leakage audit.
- Added repo-local setup, `setup-check`, first-pack smoke, and thin guidance for Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, and OpenCode.
- Added docs and a release gate that verifies tests, docs, packaging, artifact audit, selected-binary behavior, MCP proof, and optional client wrappers.

**Stats:**

- 8 phases
- 32 plans
- 70 tasks
- 203 Rust tests plus doctests passed inside the final release gate

**Archive:**

- Roadmap: `.planning/milestones/v1.1-ROADMAP.md`
- Requirements: `.planning/milestones/v1.1-REQUIREMENTS.md`
- Audit: `.planning/milestones/v1.1-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md`

**What's next:** v1.2 should focus on retrieval quality proof: broader real-repo evals, token ROI, failure modes, regression trends, and source-free benchmark reports.
